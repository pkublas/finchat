The Python code uses the 'numpy' and 'pandas' libraries to calculate the total obligations for different durations. The data is stored in a dictionary called 'data', with keys representing the duration categories and values representing the corresponding amounts.

The total obligations for each duration category are calculated using the 'obligations' variable. The 'total_obligations' variable is assigned the same value as 'oblig",12.011059
