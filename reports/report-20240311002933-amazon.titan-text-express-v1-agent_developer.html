The Python code uses the 'numpy' and 'pandas' libraries to calculate the total obligations for different durations. The data is stored in a dictionary called 'data', with keys representing the duration categories and values representing the corresponding amounts.

A DataFrame named 'df' is created from the 'data' dictionary. The 'total' column is selected as the target variable, and the remaining columns are used as features.

The total obligations for each duration category are calculated using the 'obligations' variable. The 'total_obligations' variable is assigned the same value as 'oblig</td></tr><tr><td>Single_SLG_2013_page_133.pdf-4</td><td>for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , what was the total in millions capitalized to assets associated with compensation expense related to long-term compensation plans , restricted stock and stock options?\\n</td><td>12</td><td>Answer: 1.00 %\\n</td><td>WRONG</td><td>7</td><td>Answers are different</td></tr><tr><td>Single_ETR_2008_page_336.pdf-3</td><td>what is the percent change in net revenue between 2007 and 2008?</td><td>2.4%</td><td>Answer: 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</td><td>WRONG</td><td>13</td><td>Answers are different</td></tr><tr><td>Single_BKR_2017_page_105.pdf-2</td><td>what portion of the authorized shares of class b common stock is outstanding as of december 31 , 2017?</td><td>56.6%</td><td>None</td><td>WRONG</td><td>10.010763</td><td>unknown format from LLM: </td></tr><tr><td>Single_JPM_2016_page_73.pdf-4</td><td>what was the 5 year return of the kbw bank index?</td><td>158.82%</td><td>Answer: 1.0</td><td>WRONG</td><td>7</td><td>Answers are different</td></tr><tr><td>Single_BLK_2017_page_35.pdf-4</td><td>what is the percentage change in the balance of asset allocation from 2016 to 2017?</td><td>11.2%</td><td>None</td><td>WRONG</td><td>14.29109</td><td>unknown format from LLM: a try-except block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the calculation.
